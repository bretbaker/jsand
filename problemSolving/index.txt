Step-by-Step Process (Algorithm) for General Probelm Solving

1. Understand the Problem
  - Restate the problem in own words.
  - What are the inputs?
  - What are the expected outputs?
  - Can the outputs be determined from the inputs?
  - Do I have enough information to solve the problem?
  - How should I label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem?

2. Think of Real examples
  - think of real examples to give problem context and help mind make connections

3. Break it Down
  - write out the step-by-step process required to solve the problem

4. Solve/Simplify the Problem

5. Look Back & Refactor
  - Can you check the result?
  - Can you derive the result differently?
  - Can you understand it at a glance?
  - Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
  - Can you improve the performance of the solution?
  - Can you think of other ways to refactor?
  - How have other people solved this problem?
