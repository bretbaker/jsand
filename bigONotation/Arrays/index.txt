Ordered lists
Great when you need order

Big O of basic Array interaction
Insertion - O(n)
Removal - O(n)
^^^ the reason these are O(n) is because the array has to re-index each position upon performing
^^^ the above unless the index position interacted with is the last position in the array
Searching - O(n)
Access - O(1)

Big O of basic Array methods
push - O(1)
pop - O(1)
shift - O(n)
unshift - O(n)
concat - O(n)
slice - O(n)
splice - O(n)
sort - O(nlogn)
forEach - O(n)
map - O(n)
filter - O(n)
reduce - O(n)
